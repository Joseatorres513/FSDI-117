                <h2>Jose A Torres</h2>
                <h4 class="job-title">Security & Intelligence Professional | Junior Full Stack Developer</h4>

                <p>
                    Veteran and mission-driven professional with over 10 years of combined experience in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), personnel security, and software development.
                    I have a proven record of supporting national defense operations while contributing technical solutions to mission-critical challenges.
                    Trusted to handle Top Secret/SCI clearances and sensitive information, I bring a hybrid background of operational intelligence and full-stack development to the table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my current role as a Security Analyst at the Pentagon with ARLO Solutions, I conduct comprehensive personnel clearance reviews, deliver SCI briefings, and manage secure systems like SharePoint and NIPRnet.
                    I also contribute to digital operations by editing classified forms (DD2875), updating internal HTML files, and participating in security best practice discussions across agencies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a former U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Analyst and Planner, I produced over 2,800 SIGINT reports and supported real-time intelligence missions globally.
                    I developed internal tools using Python, Flask, Django, and JavaScript, built RESTful APIs, and deployed interactive SIGINT maps using Leaflet.js and Mapbox.
                    I also trained soldiers and collaborated with multi-agency teams on secure, scalable mission technology.
                </p>
